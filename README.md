This repository demonstrates an uncommon bug in Python related to type errors during list processing. The `calculate_average` function is designed to compute the average of a list of numbers.  It includes error handling for an empty list; however, if the list contains non-numeric elements, it results in a `TypeError`. The solution showcases how to robustly handle this using exception handling.
